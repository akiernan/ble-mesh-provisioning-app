## Navigation

`AppRouter` wraps `NavigationPath`. The root view is always `DeviceDiscoveryView`. Routes:

```swift
enum AppRoute: Hashable {
    case provisioning
    case keyBinding
    case groupConfig
    case deviceControl
}
```

On app launch, `MeshProvisionerApp.onAppear` checks `meshService.hasProvisionedNetwork`. If `true` (a group at 0xC001 exists and nodes are provisioned), it immediately pushes `.deviceControl`, skipping the setup flow.

All post-provisioning screens hide the back button (`navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)`) to enforce the forward-only flow. The only way back to discovery is via factory reset.

---

## Dependency Injection

`MeshNetworkService` and `AppRouter` are created as `@State` in `MeshProvisionerApp` and injected via `.environment(meshService)` / `.environment(router)`. ViewModels receive them via constructor injection from their parent View's `@Environment`.

---

## MeshNetworkService

The central service class. `@Observable @MainActor`. Owns all BLE and mesh state.

### Init sequence

1. Creates `MeshNetworkManager`.
2. Creates `CBCentralManager` (for scanning) on `.main`.
3. Calls `setupMeshNetwork()` — loads or creates the mesh network and app key.
4. Calls `setupLocalElements()` — installs local models and configures proxy filter.

### Local Node Element Structure

The iPhone presents itself as a mesh node with one Primary Element containing 11 models:

```
Primary Element
├── GenericOnOffClient       (0x1001) — sends GenericOnOffSet to group
├── LightCTLClient           (0x1305) — sends LightCTLSet to group; receives status
├── GenericOnOffServer       (0x1000) ─┐
├── GenericLevelServer       (0x1002)  │
├── GenericDefaultTTServer   (0x1004)  │ All subscribed to 0xC001 during group config.
├── GenericPowerOnOffServer  (0x1006)  │ Enables receipt of group-addressed commands
├── GenericPowerOnOffSetup   (0x1007)  │ from external switches/dimmers.
├── LightLightnessServer     (0x1300)  │
├── LightLightnessSetup      (0x1301)  │
├── LightCTLServer           (0x1303)  │
└── LightCTLSetupServer      (0x1304) ─┘
```

**Why server models on the iPhone?** The NordicMesh library only decodes incoming mesh messages for models registered in `localElements`. Without server models subscribed to 0xC001, group-addressed commands from external switches (e.g. `GenericOnOffSetUnacknowledged`) would arrive as `UnknownMessage` and could not be pattern-matched in `didReceiveMessage`.

### Proxy Filter Strategy

```swift
manager.proxyFilter.initialState = .rejectList(addresses: [])
```

An empty reject list means the GATT proxy forwards **all** mesh traffic to the iPhone. This is critical for two reasons:

1. `ProxyFilter.add(address:)` is `internal` in the NordicMesh library — it cannot be called from app code to manage an accept list after connection.
2. The accept-list alternative would require knowing all relevant group addresses at the moment of proxy connection. The empty reject list avoids this entirely.

**CRITICAL**: Never call `proxyFilter.add(address:)` anywhere in app code. When the filter is in reject-list mode, calling `add()` would add the address to the **reject** list (blocking), not the accept list (allowing).

The filter is set via `initialState` before connection. When the proxy connects, `newProxyDidConnect()` in the library sends `SetFilterType(.rejectList)` followed by the empty list. The proxy then forwards everything. The app receives `FilterStatus` and `proxyFilter.proxy` becomes non-nil.

---

## Provisioning Pipeline

### Overview

Each device is provisioned independently over its own `PBGattBearer` (one CBCentralManager-driven GATT connection per device). The flow is sequential in `ProvisioningViewModel.runProvisioning()`.

### Sequence per device

```
1. provisionDevice(device)
   └── provisionWithPeripheral(device:peripheral:)
       ├── Create UnprovisionedDevice(uuid: device.id, ...)
       ├── Create PBGattBearer(targetWithIdentifier: peripheral.identifier)
       ├── manager.provision(unprovisionedDevice:over:bearer)  → ProvisioningManager
       ├── Create ProvisioningBearerBridge (strong reference — bearer.delegate is weak)
       ├── bearer.open()
       └── await CheckedThrowingContinuation<Node>
           ├── bearerDidOpen → pm.identify(andAttractFor: 0)
           ├── provisioningState(.requestingCapabilities) → inProgress(0.2)
           ├── provisioningState(.capabilitiesReceived)   → inProgress(0.4)
           │   └── pm.provision(algorithm: .BTM_ECDH_P256_CMAC_AES128_AES_CCM,
           │                    publicKey: .noOobPublicKey,
           │                    authenticationMethod: .noOob)
           ├── provisioningState(.provisioning)           → inProgress(0.7)
           └── provisioningState(.complete)               → inProgress(1.0) → .completed
               └── finishProvisioning(.success(node))
                   └── continuation.resume(returning: node)
2. provisionedNodes.append(node)
3. 400ms delay before next device
```

### OOB information

Extracted from the last 2 bytes (bytes 16–17) of the `MeshProvisioningService` advertisement service data. Used as `OobInformation` in `UnprovisionedDevice`. With `authenticationMethod: .noOob`, no user input is required.

### After provisioning

After the last device is provisioned, a 1-second delay allows the devices to reboot from PB-GATT mode into proxy mode before `performKeyBinding` attempts to connect.

---

## Key Binding Pipeline

`MeshNetworkService.performKeyBinding(nodes:)` — four sequential steps:

### Step 0: Connect to Proxy (`connectProxy`)

- 2-second delay to allow devices to transition from PB-GATT to proxy advertising mode.
- `connectToProxy()` scans for `MeshProxyService.uuid`, connects, and awaits bearer open.
- After bearer open, polls `manager.proxyFilter.proxy` every 100ms for up to 5 seconds until `FilterStatus` is received and the proxy is ready.

### Step 1: Generate Application Key (`generateKey`)

- Retrieves the existing app key (created during `setupMeshNetwork`) or creates a new 128-bit key bound to the network key.
- 300ms visual pause.

### Step 2: Distribute Keys (`distributeKeys`)

For each node:
1. If the node has no models (composition data not yet fetched), sends `ConfigCompositionDataGet(page: 0)` → `sendConfig()`.
2. Sends `ConfigAppKeyAdd(applicationKey: appKey)` → `sendConfig()`.
3. Per-device sub-row in the UI transitions: `.pending → .inProgress → .completed`.

### Step 3: Configure Model App Bindings (`configureModels`)

For each node:
- Iterates every element, every model.
- Skips config server (0x0000) and config client (0x0001).
- Sends `ConfigModelAppBind(applicationKey:to:model)` for every other SIG model.
- 100ms delay between binds to avoid flooding the BLE bearer.
- Per-device sub-row transitions: `.pending → .inProgress → .completed`.

---

## Group Configuration Pipeline

`MeshNetworkService.configureGroup(name:nodes:)`:

### Group address

Fixed at `0xC001`. Created in the mesh network if it doesn't already exist.

### Subscription model sets

**CTL Lightness element** (element containing `LightCTLServer` or `LightLightnessServer`):
```
0x1000 GenericOnOffServer
0x1002 GenericLevelServer
0x1004 GenericDefaultTransitionTimeServer
0x1006 GenericPowerOnOffServer
0x1007 GenericPowerOnOffSetupServer
0x1300 LightLightnessServer
0x1301 LightLightnessSetupServer
0x1303 LightCTLServer
0x1304 LightCTLSetupServer
```

**CTL Temperature element** (element containing `LightCTLTemperatureServer`):
```
0x1002 GenericLevelServer
0x1004 GenericDefaultTransitionTimeServer
0x1306 LightCTLTemperatureServer
```

Each matching model receives a `ConfigModelSubscriptionAdd(group:to:model)`.

### Switch/dimmer publication (Silvair detection)

An element containing Silvair vendor model `(CID 0x0136 << 16 | ModelID 0x0001)` is treated as a switch element. Within that element, `GenericOnOffClient` (0x1001) and `GenericLevelClient` (0x1003) are configured to publish to 0xC001 via `ConfigModelPublicationSet` with:
- TTL = 5
- Period = disabled
- Retransmit = disabled

### Local node configuration

After all remote nodes are done, the iPhone's own local node is configured:
- `ConfigModelAppBind` for each local server model in the set above.
- `ConfigModelSubscriptionAdd` to 0xC001 for each local server model.

This causes the proxy (with the empty reject list) to deliver group-addressed messages from external switches/dimmers to the app's `didReceiveMessage` callback.

### Progress reporting

Total operations are counted upfront. Each `sendConfig` call increments `completedOps` and sets `groupConfigProgress = completedOps / totalOps`. The UI also shows per-device state rows.

---

## `sendConfig` — Config Message Helper

Many config messages in the NordicMesh library return responses as `UnknownMessage` rather than their typed response class (because `ConfigurationClientHandler` only decodes messages for models it has registered). To work around this, `sendConfig` uses a custom keying mechanism:

```swift
struct ConfigContinuationKey: Hashable {
    let sourceAddress: UInt16   // node's primary unicast address
    let responseOpCode: UInt32  // expected response opCode
}
```

In `meshNetworkManager(_:didReceiveMessage:sentFrom:to:)`, **before** the loopback guard, the incoming message's `opCode` is matched against `pendingConfigContinuations`. If a match is found, the continuation is resumed. This fires regardless of whether the message is typed or `UnknownMessage`.

A fallback 8-second timeout per send prevents the pipeline from hanging if a device never responds.

---

## Proxy Connection Lifecycle

```
connectToProxy()
  ├── Guard: mesh network exists
  ├── Guard: not already connected
  ├── Wait for CBManagerState == .poweredOn (up to 5s)
  ├── scanForPeripherals(withServices: [MeshProxyService.uuid])
  ├── centralManager(_:didDiscover:) → connectToProxyPeripheral(_:)
  │   ├── Create GattBearer(targetWithIdentifier:)
  │   ├── bearer.dataDelegate = manager
  │   ├── manager.transmitter = bearer
  │   └── bearer.open()
  ├── bearerDidOpen(_:) → isConnectedToProxy = true → resume continuation
  └── Poll proxyFilter.proxy != nil (up to 5s, 100ms interval)
      └── Returns only after FilterStatus received → proxy filter ready

Auto-reconnect:
  bearer(_:didClose:) with no pending continuation + hasProvisionedNetwork
  └── 1s delay → connectToProxy()
```

The 15-second total timeout on `connectToProxy()` covers the full scan-to-bearer-open time.

---

## Message Receive Dispatch

`MeshNetworkDelegate.meshNetworkManager(_:didReceiveMessage:sentFrom:to:)` — `nonisolated`, posts all state updates to `@MainActor` via `Task { @MainActor in }`.

### Config continuation resolution (first, before any guard)

Matches `(source, message.opCode)` against `pendingConfigContinuations`. Resolves before the loopback guard so that local node config responses (source == provisioner address) are not suppressed.

### Loopback suppression

```swift
guard source != manager.meshNetwork?.localProvisioner?.primaryUnicastAddress else { return }
```

Messages the app sent to 0xC001 loop back via the proxy (TTL-1, different bytes) and are discarded by lower transport as replays (same seqAuth). The few that do reach `didReceiveMessage` would otherwise apply to `currentGroup` twice. This guard prevents that for messages originating from the local node.

### State update switch

```swift
switch message {
case GenericOnOffSetUnacknowledged:  currentGroup.isOn = cmd.isOn
case GenericOnOffStatus:             currentGroup.isOn = status.isOn
case GenericLevelSet / Unacknowledged:
    lightnessRaw = UInt16(Int32(cmd.level) + 32768)
    currentGroup.lightness = Double(lightnessRaw) / 65535
    // also updates isOn based on lightnessRaw == 0
case GenericDeltaSetUnacknowledged:
    // Relative delta — applied to current lightness
    currentLevel = Int32(currentGroup.lightness * 65535) - 32768
    newLevel = clamp(currentLevel + cmd.delta, -32768, 32767)
    lightnessRaw = UInt16(newLevel + 32768)
    currentGroup.lightness = Double(lightnessRaw) / 65535
case GenericLevelStatus:             currentGroup.lightness = ...
case LightLightnessSetUnacknowledged: currentGroup.lightness = ...
case LightLightnessStatus:           currentGroup.lightness = ...
case LightCTLSetUnacknowledged:      currentGroup.{lightness,temperature} = ...
case LightCTLStatus:                 currentGroup.{lightness,temperature} = ...
case LightCTLTemperatureRangeStatus: currentGroup.{temperatureRangeMin,Max} = ...
case LightLightnessRangeStatus:      currentGroup.{lightnessRangeMin,Max} = ...
}
```

### Level ↔ Lightness conversion

BLE Mesh `GenericLevel` range is [-32768, 32767]. BLE Mesh `LightLightness` range is [0, 65535].

```
lightness_uint16 = UInt16(Int32(level) + 32768)
lightness_double = Double(lightness_uint16) / 65535.0

level = Int32(lightness_double * 65535) - 32768
```

---

## Model Delegates

### `LightControlClientDelegate`

Assigned to local `GenericOnOffClient` and `LightCTLClient` models. Registers opcodes so the library decodes status responses as typed messages (enabling `manager.send()` continuations to resolve):

```
GenericOnOffStatus, LightCTLStatus, LightCTLTemperatureRangeStatus, LightLightnessRangeStatus,
ConfigCompositionDataStatus, ConfigAppKeyStatus, ConfigModelAppStatus,
ConfigModelSubscriptionStatus, ConfigModelPublicationStatus
```

`isSubscriptionSupported = false` — client models do not subscribe to groups.

### `LightServerDelegate`

Assigned to all 9 local server models. Registers opcodes so the library:
1. Decodes incoming set/status messages as typed objects (enabling the switch dispatch in `didReceiveMessage`).
2. Supports group subscriptions (`isSubscriptionSupported = true`).

Registered opcodes:
```
GenericOnOffSetUnacknowledged, GenericOnOffStatus,
GenericLevelSet, GenericLevelSetUnacknowledged, GenericDeltaSetUnacknowledged, GenericLevelStatus,
LightLightnessSetUnacknowledged, LightLightnessStatus,
LightCTLSetUnacknowledged, LightCTLStatus
```

`GenericLevelSet` (acknowledged) is handled by returning `GenericLevelStatus(level: cmd.level)` from `didReceiveAcknowledgedMessage` — required because some dimmers send the acknowledged variant and expect a response.

---

## State Query on Connect

`fetchCurrentState()` is called after `connectToProxy()` in `DeviceControlViewModel.connectIfNeeded()`. It queries the first provisioned node using unicast addressing (not group addressing):

1. `GenericOnOffGet` → `GenericOnOffStatus` → `currentGroup.isOn`
2. `LightCTLGet` → `LightCTLStatus` → `currentGroup.{lightness, temperature}`
3. `LightLightnessRangeGet` → `LightLightnessRangeStatus` → `currentGroup.{lightnessRangeMin, lightnessRangeMax}`
4. `LightCTLTemperatureRangeGet` → `LightCTLTemperatureRangeStatus` → `currentGroup.{temperatureRangeMin, temperatureRangeMax}`

Range values from the device clamp the UI sliders to what the hardware actually supports.

---

## Device Control Send Path

### `setOnOff(on:)`

Sends `GenericOnOffSetUnacknowledged` to `MeshAddress(0xC001)` using the app key. Updates `currentGroup.isOn` immediately after send (optimistic).

### `setLightCTL(lightness:temperature:)`

Sends `LightCTLSetUnacknowledged` to `MeshAddress(0xC001)`. Lightness is clamped to `[lightnessRangeMin, lightnessRangeMax]` (0 is a special case — sends 0 directly for off). Temperature is clamped to `[temperatureRangeMin, temperatureRangeMax]`. Transition time: 200ms.

### ACK-gated send loop (`DeviceControlViewModel`)

```
setLightness(x) or setTemperature(x)
  ├── Update currentGroup immediately (optimistic UI)
  ├── Store in pendingLightness/pendingTemperature (overwrites previous)
  └── triggerSendIfIdle()
      └── if !isSending:
          isSending = true
          Task { sendLoop() }
              └── while pending values exist:
                  consume pendingLightness + pendingTemperature
                  send LightCTLSetUnacknowledged
                  sleep 100ms (bearer drain time)
              isSending = false
```

Only the latest pending value is ever sent. Fast slider drags produce at most one in-flight send at a time with intermediate values discarded.

---

## Factory Reset

`factoryResetAllNodes()`:
1. Sends `ConfigNodeReset` to each node via `sendConfig()` (sequential, uses unicast addressing).
2. 800ms delay.
3. `resetMeshNetwork()`:
   - Disconnects and nils `proxyBearer`, `manager.transmitter`.
   - Stops BLE scan.
   - Deletes `MeshNetwork.json`.
   - Resets all `@Observable` state properties to initial values.
   - Calls `setupMeshNetwork()` + `setupLocalElements()` to create a fresh network.

---

## Concurrency Model

- `MeshNetworkService` is `@Observable @MainActor`. All state mutations happen on MainActor.
- NordicMesh delegate callbacks (`nonisolated`) bridge to MainActor via `Task { @MainActor in }`.
- `CBCentralManager` is created on `.main` queue. Its `nonisolated` delegate methods extract all non-`Sendable` values from `advertisementData` before crossing into the `Task` boundary.
- `CheckedContinuation` / `CheckedThrowingContinuation` bridge async code to callback-based APIs (provisioning, proxy connection, config messages).
- `OnceGate` (NSLock-based) ensures continuations used in race-between-operation-and-timeout are resumed exactly once.
- `ProvisioningBearerBridge` holds a strong reference to itself as a bearer delegate (since `bearer.delegate` is `weak`) via `activeBearerDelegates[deviceID]`.
